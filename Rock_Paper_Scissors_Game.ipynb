        "Sure! Here's a high-level overview of what's happening in the code:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The first section of the code defines a function called `rock_paper_scissors` that will play a game of Rock Paper Scissors with the user.\n",
        "2. The function starts by defining a list of the possible choices (rock, paper, scissors) and then asks the user for their choice using `input()`.\n",
        "3. The user's input is then converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method.\n",
        "4. The function then generates a random choice for the computer using `random.choice()`, which selects one of the possible choices randomly.\n",
        "5. The computer's choice is then printed to the user.\n",
        "6. The function then determines the winner of the game. If the user and computer chose the same thing, it's a tie. If the user chose rock and the computer chose scissors, or if the user chose paper and the computer chose rock, the user wins. Otherwise, the computer wins. The appropriate message is printed to the user depending on the outcome.\n",
        "7. Finally, the function asks the user if they want to play again by entering 'y' or 'n'. If the user enters 'y', the function calls itself recursively to play another game. If the user enters 'n', the program prints \"Goodbye!\" and ends.\n",
        "\n",
        "That's a basic overview of what's happening in the code. Let me know if you have any specific questions or if there's anything else I can help with!"
